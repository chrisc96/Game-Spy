# [Uni Taken Over, On Hold]

GameCompare aims to support more indexed websites that any game price comparison website out there. We aim to save you the most money possible. We know those steam sales aren't the same anymore.

Competition:
* Razer Deals doesn't support enough websites, often not the cheapest price.
* IsThereAnyDeal badly designed website. No proper systems in place. UPDATE: Currently down indefinitely.
* CheapShark doesn't support enough websites. Bad design, not user friendly. No integrated systems (like wishlists)

What we will be offering that no one else does:
* G2A Integration. Largest 3rd party game reseller online.
* Largest support for price comparison websites

Other features:
* Mobile friendly design
* Largest support of game website resellers
* Steam, GoG Wishlist integration
* And more.

Currently the website is in development (in development page is present). University and other commitments have taken over, but this will continue to be created when time allows.

Stay tuned.
