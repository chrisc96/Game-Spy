# GameCompare
Sick of trying to figure out whether that steam sale is actually any good? (Yeah we know, they're not what they used to be). Look no further.

GameCompare uses your Steam wishlist and compares against major third party game resellers to find you the best deal without the added effort.

Currently website is not live. Test systems and proof of concept are being written in Java. Will like be converted to JS or made into web app once proof of concept is complete.

Things may change. All template holders.

Star me, fork me, test me.

If you want to help test, I'm asking for peoples steam's wishlists here:

Cheers!
